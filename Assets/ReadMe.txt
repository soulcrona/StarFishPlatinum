There are a lot of things that may seem broken, this is because we have it balanced for long play, so upong opening you wont see much of anything. There is also the thing of you will need an android device to test the game along with my Unique key along with google collaboration enabled. This stuff I can't hand out to people so I will be demoing it on thursday or on request. However in saying that most of the game works fine it is just the google play features will need to be used on an android device, so leaderboards and everything etc
